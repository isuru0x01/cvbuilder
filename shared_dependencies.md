Shared Dependencies:

1. **Django Settings:** The `settings.py` file is shared across all Django files. It contains configurations for the Django project, including database settings, installed apps, middleware classes, and more.

2. **URL Patterns:** The `urls.py` files in the `django_project`, `users`, `cv_generator`, and `job_search` directories share URL patterns. These files define the routing of the application.

3. **Models:** The `models.py` files in the `users`, `cv_generator`, and `job_search` directories define the data schema for the application. They are used across views, forms, and admin files.

4. **Views:** The `views.py` files in the `users`, `cv_generator`, and `job_search` directories contain functions that handle requests and responses. They are used in the `urls.py` files to route requests.

5. **Forms:** The `forms.py` files in the `users`, `cv_generator`, and `job_search` directories define forms used in the application. They are used in views and templates.

6. **Admin:** The `admin.py` files in the `users`, `cv_generator`, and `job_search` directories register models to the Django admin site.

7. **Migrations:** The `migrations/0001_initial.py` files in the `users`, `cv_generator`, and `job_search` directories are generated by Django's database migration system. They are used to create, modify, or delete database tables.

8. **Templates:** The HTML files in the `templates` directory share common layout elements defined in `base_generic.html`. They also share common DOM element IDs used in the `script.js` file.

9. **Static Files:** The `style.css` and `script.js` files in the `static` directory are shared across all HTML templates. They define the styling and interactivity of the application.

10. **Media Files:** The `cv_files` and `cover_letter_files` directories in the `media` directory store uploaded files from users.

11. **Environment Variables:** The `.env` file contains environment variables used across the application, such as database credentials and API keys.

12. **Requirements:** The `requirements.txt` file lists the Python packages required for the application. It is used for setting up the development environment.

13. **Documentation:** The `README.md` file provides documentation for the application. It is used by developers and users to understand how to set up and use the application.
